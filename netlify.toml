    # This is the main build configuration for Netlify
    [build]
      # This is the command Netlify will run to build your site.
      command = "hugo"
      # This is the folder Netlify will publish after the build is successful.
      publish = "public"
    
    # This section tells Netlify which software versions to use.
    [build.environment]
      # This is the crucial part. We are telling Netlify to use a specific, recent version of Hugo.
      HUGO_VERSION = "0.125.7"
      # We can also specify the Go programming language version, which Hugo is built with.
      GO_VERSION = "1.21.0"
    ```

### **What This Configuration File Does**

* `[build]`: This section tells Netlify the basic commands. `command = "hugo"` confirms the build command, and `publish = "public"` tells it which folder contains the final website.
* `[build.environment]`: This is the important part we were missing.
    * `HUGO_VERSION = "0.125.7"`: This line instructs Netlify, "Before you do anything else, please download and install Hugo version 0.125.7." Now, when it gets to the `hugo` command, the tool will be available.


### **Part 3: Your Final Action Plan**

1.  **Create the `netlify.toml` file** in the root of your `trend-site` project.
2.  **Paste the configuration code** into the file and save it.
3.  **Push this new file** to your GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    # In your terminal inside the trend-site folder
    git add netlify.toml
    git commit -m "feat: Add netlify configuration to specify hugo version"
    git push
