On [Date of incident, if known, otherwise general phrasing] at a public event, an individual threw a shoe in the direction of India's top judge, Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud. The act was reportedly a protest linked to a contentious religious dispute, making it a notable event due to the high office of the target and the underlying religious tensions involved. The incident quickly trended across news platforms, underscoring public and political concerns over such forms of protest and the deeply emotional nature of religious conflicts in India.

Here are the key facts surrounding the incident:

*   **Target:** The incident involved Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud, the head of India's judiciary, during his address at a public gathering.
*   **Nature of Protest:** A shoe was thrown by an individual identified as a member of a Hindu activist group. The thrower reportedly shouted slogans related to a specific religious dispute, indicating the protest's motivation.
*   **Context:** The act was directly linked to the ongoing legal proceedings concerning the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, a highly sensitive case currently being heard by various courts, including the Supreme Court. The thrower expressed dissatisfaction with the judicial handling of the matter.
*   **Outcome:** The shoe did not hit the Chief Justice, and the individual responsible was immediately apprehended by security personnel present at the venue.

The incident is rooted in the long-standing and deeply emotive Gyanvapi mosque dispute. The mosque, situated in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, stands adjacent to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple, one of Hinduism's holiest sites. For decades, Hindu groups have claimed that the mosque was built on the ruins of an ancient Hindu temple, alleging that parts of the original temple structure are still visible within the mosque complex. This claim has led to numerous legal battles, with various petitions seeking the right for Hindu worship within the mosque premises, or for the mosque site to be declared a Hindu temple. Recent court orders, including those from lower courts and the Allahabad High Court, allowing surveys of the mosque complex and prayers in certain areas, have intensified the legal and communal discourse. The Supreme Court has been involved in hearing appeals and petitions related to these developments, making it a focal point for both sides of the dispute.

This extraordinary event, though isolated and non-injurious, serves as a stark illustration of the intense passions and frustrations surrounding unresolved religious land disputes in India, underscoring the challenges faced by the judiciary in navigating such sensitive issues.
