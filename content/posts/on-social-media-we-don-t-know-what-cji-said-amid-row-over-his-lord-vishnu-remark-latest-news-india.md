The headline, "'On social media, we don't know…': What CJI said amid row over his Lord Vishnu remark | Latest News India," refers to recent statements made by India's Chief Justice (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud addressing a controversy that erupted online. The controversy stemmed from a remark he made earlier, which included a reference to Lord Vishnu. This topic has become a prominent headline due to the high office held by the CJI, the sensitive nature of religious references within India's secular judicial system, and the broader discussion it ignites about the role and impact of social media on public perception of the judiciary.

Here are the key aspects of the situation:

*   **The Original Remark:** During a hearing concerning the management of the Ayodhya Temple, CJI D.Y. Chandrachud reportedly cited a verse from the Manusmriti, which included a reference to Lord Vishnu and the concept that "Dharma is sustained by truth." This was apparently in the context of discussing the duties and responsibilities of the temple's trust.
*   **The Social Media "Row":** Following this citation, a significant debate and discussion unfolded on various social media platforms. Some individuals criticized the remark, interpreting it as potentially inappropriate for a secular judicial head to make religious references in court. Others defended it, viewing it as a mere academic or philosophical citation within a legal context, not an endorsement of a specific faith.
*   **CJI's Response to the Row:** Amidst this online discourse, CJI Chandrachud subsequently made observations regarding social media. He reportedly stated, "On social media, we don't know who is commenting, what they are commenting... We are judges, we do our work... Our job is to apply the law." This statement underscored the judiciary's focus on legal principles and its detachment from the often unverified or emotionally charged commentary found online.

The significance of this topic lies in several aspects. India is a secular democracy, and the neutrality of its judiciary is paramount. Any perceived deviation, even in citation, can trigger public debate. The incident also highlights the growing challenge faced by public institutions, including the judiciary, in navigating the digital age. Social media, while a powerful tool for information dissemination, can also be a hotbed for misinformation, misinterpretation, and the amplification of specific narratives, sometimes without full context. The CJI's remarks can be seen as an attempt to re-emphasize the judiciary's role as an independent arbiter of law, distinct from public opinion shaped by online discussions. It underscores the court's commitment to the rule of law over the noise of digital platforms.

Ultimately, this incident spotlights the delicate balance between judicial conduct, public perception, and the pervasive influence of social media in contemporary Indian society.
