The headline "‘This hill was never ...’: What caused Himachal landslide that buried a moving bus, killing 18 in..." refers to a tragic and significant natural disaster that occurred in Himachal Pradesh, India. It encapsulates the deep concern and questions surrounding a massive landslide event in August 2021 where a large section of a mountain collapsed, sweeping away vehicles, most notably a state transport bus, and resulting in the loss of 18 lives. The phrase "‘This hill was never ...’" highlights local residents' observations that the specific area had not historically been prone to such large-scale collapses, making the event particularly alarming and prompting a widespread inquiry into its causes. This incident became a top headline due to its severe human toll, the dramatic nature of the disaster, and the ongoing debate about the increasing frequency and intensity of such events in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.

Here are some key facts and context regarding the Himachal landslide:

*   **Location and Date:** The devastating landslide occurred on August 11, 2021, near Chaura village in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, a mountainous northern Indian state.
*   **Human Impact:** The disaster tragically claimed at least 18 lives, with several others injured. The victims included passengers on a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus that was completely buried under the debris, along with other vehicles caught in the rockfall.
*   **Observed Causes:** Preliminary assessments and expert opinions pointed to a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, the fragile geological structure of the Himalayas, and potentially the destabilization of slopes due to road construction and other developmental activities in the region. The "never before" sentiment expressed by locals underscored the perceived unusual magnitude of this particular event.

Himachal Pradesh, situated in the geologically active and young Himalayan range, is inherently susceptible to landslides due to its steep slopes, loose soil, and seismic activity. The monsoon season, typically from July to September, brings heavy rainfall, which saturates the soil and further destabilizes slopes, making landslides a recurrent hazard. However, this particular event, along with an observed increase in similar incidents in recent years, has amplified concerns among environmentalists and geologists. They suggest a complex interplay of natural vulnerabilities with anthropogenic factors, such as extensive infrastructure development, road widening projects involving blasting, and the potential impacts of climate change leading to more intense and unpredictable rainfall patterns. The quote from the locals emphasizes a perceived shift in the stability of certain areas, drawing attention to how human activities might be altering the natural landscape's resilience.

This Himachal landslide serves as a stark reminder of the escalating risks posed by natural hazards in environmentally sensitive regions, intensified by a confluence of geological vulnerabilities, climate change, and human developmental pressures.
