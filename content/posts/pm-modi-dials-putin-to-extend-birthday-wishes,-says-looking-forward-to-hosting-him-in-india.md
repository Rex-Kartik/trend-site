Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently called Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend birthday wishes and expressed his eagerness to host President Putin in India. This news is trending because it highlights the continued diplomatic engagement between India and Russia, a relationship that holds significant geopolitical weight, especially amid ongoing international developments and Western sanctions against Moscow. The call underscores India's consistent approach to its foreign policy, maintaining ties with various global powers.

Here are the key aspects of this interaction:

*   **Personal Diplomacy:** The primary purpose of the call was for PM Modi to personally congratulate President Putin on his birthday, reflecting a degree of personal rapport between the two leaders.
*   **Invitation to India:** PM Modi's statement about "looking forward to hosting him in India" signifies an upcoming high-level bilateral meeting or summit. Such a visit would be a crucial opportunity for both nations to discuss and deepen cooperation across various sectors.
*   **Continued Strategic Engagement:** The phone call reaffirms the strong strategic partnership between India and Russia. It signals that despite global pressures and shifts, both countries remain committed to their long-standing relationship.

The relationship between India and Russia dates back decades, with roots in the Cold War era when the then-Soviet Union was a key strategic partner for India, particularly in defense and technology. This partnership evolved into a "Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership," encompassing cooperation in areas such as defense, energy, space, trade, and nuclear power. High-level visits and regular dialogues between the leaders of both nations have been a consistent feature of this relationship, serving as platforms to reinforce ties and address mutual interests. India's defense relies significantly on Russian military hardware, and Russia remains a vital source of energy, especially crude oil, for India. This historical context explains the routine yet significant nature of such high-level diplomatic exchanges.

This interaction between Prime Minister Modi and President Putin underscores the enduring nature of India-Russia relations and India's commitment to pursuing an independent foreign policy that prioritizes its national interests and partnerships.
